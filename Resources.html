              My research interests include water and wastewater treatment, desertification, sustainable agriculture and development, bioremediation, groundwater, and ecohydrology. One subject I would like to explore is decentralized wastewater treatment and its potential to revolutionize the current wastewater treatment paradigm. Meeting the sanitation needs of communities in both developed and developing nations requires innovative solutions, and decentralized wastewater treatment can play a large role in meeting those needs while also satisfying financial, environmental, and health requirements. My professional goal is to acquire experience working in private industry and to eventually pursue a career in academia.

              From January to June of 2018, I was responsible for constructing and operating rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCT) designed to measure arsenic adsorption, for analyzing
        the samples via ICP-MS, and for writing reports for the consulting firm that commissioned the work.
