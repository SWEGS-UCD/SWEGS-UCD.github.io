                The event will take place on Friday April 29th from 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM and is free for all participants. See schedule below. Use this link to register: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/uc-davis-ewr-showcase-tickets-293080199767<br>
                <br>
                <li><b>Keynote Speaker: Michele Barbarto</b>  -- We are excited to announce that the keynote speaker for the UC Davis Showcase 2022 is Dr. Michele Barbarto. Dr. Barbato is working on the modeling, analysis, and design of structures subject to single and multiple hazards. He is also interested in wildfire risk assessment. Dr. Barbato’s research focuses on the interface between high-fidelity finite element modeling and advanced probabilistic methods to develop novel design approaches and structural solutions based on innovative, sustainable materials and construction techniques. These efforts lead to new designs and structures that support societal efforts in climate change mitigation and adaptation.</li> <br>
                <br>                 
                <li><b> Oral Presentations: Dr. Alissa Kendall and Dr. Scott Bradford </b> - Our first presenter is Dr. Alissa Kendall, professor in the civil and environmental engineering department at UC Davis. Her research applies and advances the methods and perspectives of Industrial Ecology to understand and reduce the environmental effects of transport, civil infrastructure, energy, and agricultural systems. Specific research and teaching interests include life cycle assessment and other structured environmental assessment methods, and the development of new methods for carbon accounting.
                Our second presenter is Dr. Scott Bradford, a soil scientist in the Sustainable Agricultural Water Systems Unit at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Dr. Bradford’s research interests includes mechanisms and models for colloid and colloid-facilitated transport and fate, comprehensive nutrient management plans, and analytic models. He is also interested in multiphase flow, transport, and interphase mass transfer processes in porous media along with the development and design of animal waste management practices and treatments.</li> <br> 
                <br> 
                <li><b>Registration for Poster Session</b>  -- We would like to encourage you all to present ongoing research as posters during the event. The poster presentation session will offer the opportunity for students and researchers to share their work with fellow students, peers, and others. The posters will be printed a week before the event to accommodate for late modifications and adjustments. The poster presentations are scheduled from 2:45 pm to 4:45 pm along with the networking session. The event is open to both graduate and undergraduate students.Please use this link to sign up if you are interested: https://lnkd.in/gDT-2Mu2 </p> </a> </li> <br>
