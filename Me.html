                Born in Sacramento, California, I've moved around from Amador County to Oklahoma to the Bay Area, and eventually to the foothills of The Sierra Nevada near Placerville. As the son of a horse trainer, I spent the first part of my childhood riding horses and chasing cows. The second half was dominated by my serious baseball ambitions and by the cello.

                    I chose to attend the University of Redlands in 2013 to study chemistry, but later transferred to Folsom Lake College and Santa Rosa Junior College (SRJC) for a semester each after choosing to pursue a career in baseball. After a month at SRJC, I decided to quit baseball and transfer to UC Davis. Given my interest in environmental issues and my desire to work with my hands, civil and environmental engineering was a perfect fit. I graduated with a bachelor's degree from UC Davis in June 2019, and am currently there working on a master's degree.

                   I am an avid hiker and backpacker, I am interested in sustainable agriculture and enjoy growing my own food, and I take great pleasure in fermenting and drying all kinds of foods. More recently, I have become interested in judo and go/weiqi/baduk. I love travelling, and I especially like to WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms). I spent nine weeks in Japan WWOOFing around the countryside and loved every minute of it. My favorite authors include Wallace Stegner, John Irving, Douglas Adams, Larry McMurtry, Masanobu Fukuoka, and J.R.R. Tolkien.
